# AOT Region Backend — Performance Results

Every number here is reproducible from the commands given. Nothing is
extrapolated, and any measurement that could not be taken on this host is marked
**not measured** rather than estimated.

| OS | Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200 |
| Compiler | clang 20.1.8 (`C:\lm\extern\clang+llvm-20.1.8-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) |
| LLVM | 20.1.8 |
| Host triple | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| Generator | Ninja, `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` |
| Target triple | default (host); `DOLRECOMP_LLVM_TARGET` unset |
| Target CPU / features | LLVM defaults; not yet overridable (Phase 6 adds `--target-cpu` / `--target-features`) |
| PGO | off (`DOLRECOMP_LLVM_PGO` unset) |
| LTO | off (not yet implemented; Phase 6) |
| Region mode | `fixed` (only mode that exists at this commit) |

> The system LLVM at `C:\Program Files\LLVM` is clang 22.1.5 and ships no CMake
> package. DolRecomp's CMake hard-errors outside LLVM 19–20, so it cannot be
> used. All results use the 20.1.8 tree above.

## 3. Correctness baseline

`ctest` at `fa0cf61`, LLVM enabled: **19/19 passed** (3.43 s).
After Phase 0a adds `test_perf`: **20/20 passed**.

No test was deleted, skipped or weakened.

## 4. Untouched baseline — Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

Both backends translate the same 742,616 guest instructions.

| | C backend | Fixed-chunk LLVM |
|---|---:|---:|
| Regions (chunks) | 182 | 5,803 |
| Guest instructions | 742,616 | 742,616 |
| Guest instructions per region | 4,080.3 | 128.0 |
| Generated code bytes | 195,919,659 (187 MB C source) | 362,681,990 (346 MB objects) |
| Output files | 182 chunks + header | 5,803 objects + header |
| Recompile wall time | 0.50 s (`-j8`) | see §5 |

The two "code bytes" figures are **not comparable to each other** — one is C
source text, the other native object files. They are each comparable only
against their own future numbers.

### Why 128

`src/app/pipeline.c` documents the existing measurement (LLVM-EXPERIMENTS
E002/E003, Mario Kart). A chunk becomes exactly one LLVM function, so chunk size
is the scope over which the register allocator must keep the promoted guest
register file live:

| Chunk instructions | `.text` bytes | Speed | Δ |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1024 | 1,012,522,870 | 0.3288 | — |
| 256 | 450,227,766 | 0.4404 | +33.9% |
| 128 | 345,215,974 | 0.5192 | +57.9% |

Monotonic, disjoint confidence ranges at every step.

**This is the finding that motivates the whole region effort.** The current
backend buys tolerable code size by cutting the program every 128 instructions,
and pays a state materialization plus a dispatcher round trip at every cut. A
CFG-aware region ends at a boundary chosen for control flow instead of an
arbitrary instruction count, so it does not have to make that trade uniformly:
hot loops and hot caller/callee pairs stay whole, and cold code is where the
cuts land.

---

## 5. Build time

`-j12`, cache directory `DOLRECOMP_LLVM_CACHE`.

| Scenario | Wall time |
|---|---:|
| C backend, `-j8` | 0.50 s |
| LLVM, clean — 5,803 misses | 512 s |
| LLVM, partial cache — 1,202 hits / 4,601 misses | 213 s |
| LLVM, full cache hit — 5,803 hits | _measurement in flight_ |

The clean LLVM build is ~1000× the C backend's wall time for the same 742,616
guest instructions. That is the budget any ThinLTO stage in Phase 6 has to fit
inside without making the development loop unusable, which is why the non-LTO
path is retained and why cache-hit time is tracked separately.

## 5a. Whole-title CFG model

`build/cfg_stats <main.dol>`. Both titles supplied locally, neither committed.

| | Mario Kart: Double Dash!! | Luigi's Mansion |
|---|---:|---:|
| Sections | 2 | 2 |
| Code instructions (non-data) | 727,020 | 518,717 |
| Covered by blocks | 727,020 (100.00%) | 518,717 (100.00%) |
| Basic blocks | 161,404 | 111,912 |
| Functions | 29,021 | 24,418 |
| SCCs | 146,182 | 103,294 |
| Loop headers | 4,307 | 2,517 |
| Indirect sites | 20,134 | 14,003 |
| Blocks owned by no function | 0 | 0 |

MKDD terminator mix: 49,176 conditional branches, 40,316 calls, 20,464
branches, 19,906 fallthroughs, 14,988 returns, 5,146 indirect, 11,349 unknown
(section end or data boundary), 38 system, 21 tail calls.

### Function entries cannot come from `bl` targets alone

Seeding function entries only from direct call targets left **59.47% of Mario
Kart's code owned by no function**. The roots of that were 22,010 blocks with no
in-edge anywhere in the program — reached only through a vtable slot, a
function-pointer table, or a jump table, which is what a C++ title looks like.

Treating a block that no direct edge reaches as an entry point by elimination
brought unowned code to 0.11%, and seeding the residual — cycles where every
member has an in-edge from inside the cycle — closed it to **0.00%** on both
titles. Function count rises from 6,997 to 29,021 on MKDD accordingly.

This infers *entries*, never edges. Nothing here claims to know which indirect
site reaches which entry; that is Phase 4's job. But it means region formation
sees the whole title rather than the directly-called 40% of it.

## 5b. Region planning

`build/cfg_stats <main.dol> --compare-modes --region-max-instructions N`

Region crossings are the metric: each one is a boundary control flow has to
traverse, which under the current backend means a state materialization and a
dispatcher round trip. Internal edges are the mirror — control flow that stays
inside one compiled unit and can be a native branch.

### Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, limit 1024

| Mode | Regions | Instr/region | **Crossings** | Internal edges | Split functions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| fixed | 13,281 | 54.7 | 52,249 | 170,970 | 0 |
| function | 29,025 | 25.0 | 50,814 | 172,405 | 4 |
| cfg | 19,563 | 37.2 | **35,035** | 188,184 | 4 |

### Luigi's Mansion, limit 1024

| Mode | Regions | Instr/region | **Crossings** | Internal edges | Split functions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| fixed | 11,254 | 46.1 | 40,603 | 110,321 | 0 |
| function | 24,418 | 21.2 | 39,794 | 111,130 | 0 |
| cfg | 16,495 | 31.4 | **26,965** | 123,959 | 0 |

**CFG accretion removes 33.0% of crossings on MKDD and 33.6% on Luigi's
Mansion** against the CFG-blind arm — two unrelated titles landing within 0.6
points of each other. `function` mode barely helps on its own (2.7% / 2.0%),
which is the useful negative result: the win is co-locating callers with
callees, not respecting function boundaries.

At limit 128 the same comparison gives 58,989 → 47,613 crossings on MKDD
(19.3%), so the benefit grows with the size budget, as expected.

> **Comparison caveat.** The `fixed` arm here is CFG-blind cutting every N guest
> instructions, additionally broken at address discontinuities where embedded
> data interrupts code. The shipped LLVM backend chunks raw instruction indices
> *including* data and produces 5,803 regions of exactly 128. So `fixed` here is
> not a byte-for-byte reproduction of the shipped chunker — it is a controlled
> arm measured through the identical edge model as the other two modes. The
> shipped backend's real crossing count is not measurable until the region
> backend emits code and the runtime counters populate.

### Call edges are counted explicitly

A `CALL` block's successor is its *return point*, not its callee, so walking
successors alone never sees the call. On MKDD that would have hidden 40,316 of
the transfers the plan exists to remove, and co-locating a caller with its
callee would have scored as no improvement at all. Call and tail-call edges are
therefore resolved to the callee's region and counted separately.

## 6. Runtime counters

**Not measured at this commit.** The Phase 0a runtime counters exist and compile
out correctly, but nothing emits `DOLRECOMP_PERF_INC()` into generated code yet —
that lands with the region backend, which is what those counters are for.

Reporting a runtime column here would be reporting zeros as if they were
observations. The performance gates in §7 are therefore all still open.

---

## 7. Performance completion gates

Baseline is the fixed-chunk LLVM backend. All gates open at this commit.

| Gate | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Dispatcher entries in hot gameplay | ≥50% fewer | open |
| Full `CPUState` materializations | ≥50% fewer | open |
| Cross-region transfers needing returned-PC validation | ≥50% fewer | open |
| Ordinary RAM ops on a direct/compact fast path | ≥80% | open |
| Generic slow memory helper calls | material reduction | open |
| CPU-thread time, primary benchmark | ≥15% lower | open |
| Second representative workload | no regression >5% | open |
| Correctness divergence | none | open |
| Code size vs fixed LLVM | prefer <25% growth | open |

---

## 8. Platform status

| Target | Status |
|---|---|
| x86-64 Windows | building and tested (this host) |
| x86-64 Linux | available via WSL2 Ubuntu — not yet measured |
| AArch64 Linux | no native host; cross-compile only |
| arm64 macOS | excluded (machine reserved for other work) |
| x86-64 macOS | no host |

AArch64 cross-compilation can be configured, but NEON paired-single lowering,
fastmem address calculation and the runtime ABI need a real execution
environment before that deliverable can be called done. Recorded in
[AOT-REGION-IMPLEMENTATION.md](AOT-REGION-IMPLEMENTATION.md) §9.

## 9. Remaining bottlenecks

Identified, not yet addressed:

1. **128-instruction chunk boundaries** (§4) — the dominant architectural cost.
2. **`g_mem_write_journal` checked on every store** (`src/cpu/cpu.h`) — an
   unconditional branch on a global function pointer in the store path. Phase 5
   removes it from production builds via explicit journaling modes.
3. **No cross-chunk direct calls by default** — gated behind
   `DOLRECOMP_UNSAFE_DIRECT_CALLS` because it bypasses chassis dispatch
   validation. Phase 3 makes this safe and default.
4. **No whole-program optimization** — objects are emitted independently with no
   final link-time inlining or internalization. Phase 6 adds ThinLTO.
